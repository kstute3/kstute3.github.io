        <p>I presented this project after a year of working on it to the faculty at St. Luke's in New Canaan, Ct. After seeing this presentation, I got an internship with the marketing and communications team for this upcoming summer, <time datetime="2023">2023</time>.</p>

        <p>One of my favorite things that I have done is make magazine spreads. In my senior year of high school I made an independent study where I made a magazine for my high school. I learned about InDesign and the rules of layout. Once I learned the rules of layout, was when I started to break these rules and make the spreads more visually appealing.</p>

          <p>In my first semester at UMiami, I took introduction to graphic design. I was given the task of making a travel campign for a specific expierience in a location. We had to make a poster, billboard and brochure. These were made up of a compellation of multiple images blended with one another.</p>
          <p>My campaign was selling a sailing experience in Santorini, Greece. The poster and billboard were made using Adobe Photoshop and the brochure was made using Adobe InDesign.</p>
          <p>Today, I am working on a similar project in advanced graphic design. I am making a advertising campaign for a new season of a television series. Like my travel campaign, I am making posters and billboards, but I am also learning how to make merchandise using Adobe Photoshop, Illustrator and Indesign.</p>

          <p>I also worked on magazine layouts in my first semester at UMiami in my visual design class and introduction of graphic design.</p> 
          <p>In introduction to graphic design, I made a fashion magazine for fashion week. The Bella hadid spread was my feature article. The exmaple shown, is the introduction to the feature.</p>
          <p>In visual design, I made a dance magazine. In this project, I learned about how to make a infographic. It was difficult to make it visually appealing while also adding in as much information about the topic as possible. Other than this spread, I learned about making a feature spread in a magazine.</p>
          <p>I love making magazines in class and outside on my own time. I appreciate that there are rules, but aslo that it is encouraged to break these rules. I don't like to make basic boring spreads that are just there to give the reader information. I like it to be visually appealing, while also providing the information.</p> 
          <p>I use my background in magazine design when working on my schools newspaper to make it more creative. Newspapers are going out and I feel it is important to make it more of an experience</p>

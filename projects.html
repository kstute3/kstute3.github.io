        <p>One of my favorite things that I have done is make magazine spreads. In my senior year of high school I made an independent study where I made a magazine for my high school. I learned about InDesign and the rules of layout. Once I learned the rules of layout, was when I started to break these rules and make the spreads more visually appealing.</p>

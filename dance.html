            <h3>Nikiya from La Bayadare</h3>
              <p>Nikiya is the protagonist of the ballet La Bayadere, a tragic love story set in India. She is a temple dancer (bayadere) who falls in love with the warrior Solor, who is promised to another woman. Nikiya's love for Solor drives the story forward, as she struggles against the interference of the High Brahmin and the Rajah's daughter, who also loves Solor. Despite her tragic end, Nikiya is celebrated as one of the most iconic and challenging roles in classical ballet, known for its demanding technical and dramatic requirements.</p>
              <p>I performed Nikiya in <time datetime="2019">2019</time> in the Connecticut Classic Ballet Competition. I recieved third place in the junior classical division. This has been my favorite solo competition piece I have performed. I loved the slow and emotional dance.</p>
              <p>This was the first time I ever danced in a dance competition. My studio is know for performance dance, but created a competition team in <time datetime="2019">2019</time>. The team started off with just three girls the first year and now has grown to over 20 girls.</p>

            <h3>Arabian from The Nutcracker</h3>
            <p>The Arabian Princess is a character in the ballet The Nutcracker, portrayed in a pas de deux with the Prince. She is depicted as a mysterious and sensual figure, dancing in a slow and sinuous style with flowing veils and exotic movements.</p>
            <p>This role was my first big lead role that I performed at my studio. It was a partnered dance with my director, Ted Thomas. I continued to dance with Ted for years to come and even went on tour with his professional dance company performing solo ballet dances and group modern pieces.</p> 
            <p>I actually started off at this role as an understudy. Sadly, the girl that was supposed to do it broke her back. For this dance, you need to have a very flexible but strong back. You are being thrown into deep backbends fast. Having to partner, you need to make sure that you can still keep the support in your back for the hard lifts.</p>
            <p>Arabian has always been my favorite piece from The Nutcracker. I started learning the dance in my first partnering classes when I was in eigth grade. This was the year that my older sister performed the pas. I loved watching her do it and always dreamed of doing it myself on stage one year.</p>

            <h3>Sugar Plum from The Nutcracker</h3>
            <p>The Sugar Plum Fairy is a character in the ballet The Nutcracker, and is the ruler of the Land of Sweets. She is portrayed as a graceful figure, dancing in a light and delicate style with quick footwork and intricate pointe work. The Sugar Plum Fairy is a celebrated role in ballet, and her solo dance, the "Dance of the Sugar Plum Fairy," is one of the most recognizable and beloved pieces of classical music.</p>
            <p>This role was my hardest role I did in The Nutcracker. Due to Covid-19, the first year I performed this role I did the whole thing wearing a mask. This helped me build up my stamina. The next year, we were finally able to take off our masks and we performed with the Norwalk Symphony Orchestra.</p>
